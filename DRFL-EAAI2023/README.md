Accurate Medical Image Segmentation</h2>

 This repository contains the code for the paper  Dual-stream Representation Fusion Learning for
Accurate Medical Image Segmentation


## Getting Started

### Requirement

```bash 
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Prepare Dataset

Please divide the data set into train and test, where there are three files of images, masks and sr under each directory. The directory structure is similar to ./data.  The super-resolution images generated by https://github.com/uw-loci/demo_wsi_superres are placed under the sr directory.


### Train Model
```bash 
python train.py -config config.yml -name model_name -gpu_ids gpu_id
```
### Test Model

```bash 
python test.py -config config.yml -name model_name -gpu_ids gpu_id
```

You can use test_select.py to choose the best threshold:

```bash
python test_select.py -config config.yml -name model_name -gpu_ids gpu_id
```
